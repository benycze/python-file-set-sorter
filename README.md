# Python File Set Analysis

This tool provides a simple analysis of files passed as inputs of the program. The user divides files with strings into two categories:
* Set A - list of files in the first set
* Set B - list of files in the second set

After that, the tool runs the analysis where it takes all elements in the set A (e.g. file contents) and compares them with the set B, where the record from A is added to the:
* Unique set - there is no such record in the set A
* Non-unique set - there is a match in the second B

This tool is just a quickly implemented because I needed to solve this as fast as possible and I didn't know about any suitable tool 
which is available online
